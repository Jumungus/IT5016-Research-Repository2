# IT5016 - Research-Repository
### Aiden McFall 20220194 Whitecliffe

For this assignment, I am expected to create a research repository.

My Research Repository is:
- a collection of my own code
- code that I've been inspired by (with comments)
- things that I think are interesting or just don't understand (with comments)

By collating and shareing these to my school using GitHub, I am building up my practice and research and documenting it all at once.
