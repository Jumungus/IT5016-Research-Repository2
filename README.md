# IT5016 - Research-Repository
### Aiden McFall 20220194 Whitecliffe

For this assignment, you're expected to create a research repository.

Your Research Repository is:
- a collection of your own code
- code that you've been inspired by (with comments)
- things that you think are interesting or just don't understand (with comments)

By collating these and share these with us using GitHub you are building up your practice and research and documenting it all at once.
