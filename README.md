# IT5016 - Research-Repository
### Aiden McFall 20220194 Whitecliffe

For this assignment, I am expected to create a research repository.
My Research Repository is:
- a collection of my own code
- code that I've been inspired by (with comments)
- things that I think are interesting or just don't understand (with comments)
By collating and sharing these to my school using GitHub, I am building up my practice and research and documenting it all at once.

## Research and Exploration
#### Ability to resource, generate and develop ideas, programming practices and research
In this section I will Propose, develop and sustain a range of interests and ideas which are directly related to my personal learning style and learning goals.
I will attempt to extend my ideas and methods with study of established theory, practice and processes of others.


#### Scratch
During a lecture the class played around with Scratch.
Scratch is a visual programming language, I experimented with to help better understand and conceptualise some of the fundamentals of programming.
This tool helped me experiment and understand some data science fundamentals such as:
- variables
- loops
- arithmetic operations 
- control flow
- user inputs

Scratch uses unique templates of pieces similar to a jigsaw puzzle, allowing me to conceptualise data science fundamentals in a more friendly way.
I tested some games people had built to learn decide what mechanics I will use for my game.
I built a few games both with unique controls and win conditions.

### GitHub
GitHub is a site where you can upload, edit and test code on your own or collaboratively as a team. GitHub includes Git which is a software for tracking changes in any set of files.
During one of my lectures my professor recommended we get started with the basics of GitHub early to make it easier in the future when it will undoubtedly become a useful tool.
I learned some of the basics of mark-up, a text formatting language used to write and comment on GitHub pages as well as learning other options such as HTML.
I forked my professor's GitHub repository to get an idea of how code sharing actually works as well as making my own GitHub pages where I could test some mark-up formatting and start a research depository as seen below.

### Python
Python is a beginner friendly programming language that runs on almost all system architectures.
I researched some programs to see what can be built on python and was quickly shown just how versatile it can be with programs from web development to machine learning.
I have been learning the basics of python and will show some of my practice later on in my repository.
