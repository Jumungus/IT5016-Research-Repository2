# IT5016 - Research-Repository
### Aiden McFall 20220194 Whitecliffe

For this assignment, I am expected to create a research repository.
My Research Repository is:
- a collection of my own code
- code that I've been inspired by (with comments)
- things that I think are interesting or just don't understand (with comments)
By collating and sharing these to my school using GitHub, I am building up my practice and research and documenting it all at once.

<br>

## Research and Exploration
#### Ability to resource, generate and develop ideas, programming practices and research
In this section I will Propose, develop and sustain a range of interests and ideas which are directly related to my personal learning style and learning goals.
I will attempt to extend my ideas and methods with study of established theory, practice and processes of others.


#### Scratch
During a lecture the class played around with Scratch.
Scratch is a visual programming language, I experimented with to help better understand and conceptualise some of the fundamentals of programming.
This tool helped me experiment and understand some data science fundamentals such as:
- variables
- loops
- arithmetic operations 
- control flow
- user inputs

Scratch uses unique templates of pieces similar to a jigsaw puzzle, allowing me to conceptualise data science fundamentals in a more friendly way.
I tested some games people had built to learn decide what mechanics I will use for my game.
I built a few games both with unique controls and win conditions.

### GitHub & Markdown
GitHub is a site where you can upload, edit and test code on your own or collaboratively as a team. GitHub includes Git which is a software for tracking changes in any set of files.
During one of my lectures my professor recommended we get started with the basics of GitHub early to make it easier in the future when it will undoubtedly become a useful tool.
I learned some of the basics of mark-up, a text formatting language used to write and comment on GitHub pages as well as learning other options such as HTML.
I forked my professor's GitHub repository to get an idea of how code sharing actually works as well as making my own GitHub pages where I could test some mark-up formatting and start a research depository as seen below.

### Python
Python is a beginner friendly programming language that runs on almost all system architectures.
I researched some programs to see what can be built on python and was quickly shown just how versatile it can be with programs from web development to machine learning.
I have been learning the basics of python and will show some of my practice later on in my repository.

## Analysis and Evaluation
#### Ability to critically analyse and evaluate creative process and research towards achieving creative outcomes.
In this section I will apply and prove my understanding of computer science and programming languages, specifically python by producing and experimenting with creative programs.
I realise to achive my goals I will need to learn and pratice my programing. So I practised my python with small challenges online. Below are a few examples demonstrating my current python ability as well as why I believed it was worth adding to my research repository


### Practical inputs, calculations & conversions
Below is a function I built that can take multiple inputs and compare them to a predetermined condition.
This is a good example of how a basic function can be used practically.

### Arithmetic operations
Below is a function I built demonstrating some practical inputs, calculations and conversions in a python.

<a href="pythonexample2"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yVLs1xK.png" title="pythonexample2" /></a>

### Python challenge
Below is a function I built as an educational challange demonstrating the usage of:
- Functions: sum() and len()
- The .append method 
- Lists
- Datatype conversions
- User input
- While loops

<a href="pythonexample3"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vTyXH7t.png" title="pythonexample3" /></a>

### Recursive function
During some python practice I built a simple program that will repeat untill it gets a responce it is happy with.
Recursive programs seem to be a big part of how python is built and used.

### tKinter
I realised I didn’t know how user interfaces are built and managed, I did some research and learned about Tkinter, a python module I can import which allows me to build and design custom GUIs for my code.
After some study and researching common uses I practised building with tkinter. I found this was helpful for me as most software I have ever used has intractable interfaces and helped me envision pontital for future more advanced projects.

## Application of Knowledge and Understanding
#### Ability to integrate research, knowledge and understanding with practice to achieve creative outcomes.
In this section I will demonstrate comprehensive knowledge and understanding of appropriate principles and processes by building a program as well as explaining and  justifying my creative processes.

I wanted to test my creative and planning processes so I decided to extensively plan and build a piece of software.
I decided to build a basic calculator as I could then focus primarily on my planning and execution of the program.
Below I will record my development process including my work enviroment/setup aswell as my planning, testing and presentation/use of the project.

### Paper Plan
I sketched up a basic paper plan on drawing.io this plan had my design for my GUI as well as the arithmetic operations I wish for it to perform.

### Development of Application
For the development of this application I will be using Notepad++ and Visual Studio Code as my text editor, many options for editors would work and I only chose these two programs because of my previous practice and proficiency with them. Im giving myself a timeframe of a week to complete my program which is plenty of time. I will however aim to finish most of the build early to allow some freedom to test, polish and potentially fix the application as well as giving me time to update my research repository before It is due.

### Installation and Configuration of Tools To Set Up The Lab Environment
The installation and configuration of tools and software that I will be using to create this program are Python, Visual Studio Code and Notepad++. This is mostly setup on the Whitecliffe student computers already. I imported the Python module Tkinter with from tkinter import* This line of code imports a set of pre-made functions which I can use to build graphical user interfaces like the one in the software model prototype above. As always within an IT lab environment it is safe to expect slight issues and disruptions as I build my program however with my IT experience I am confident that I can overcome them.

I found it important to keep track of my lab environment so I can know the fundamental limitations and requirements of my software so I can replicate my environment if I ever wish to share or use it somewhere else.

### Testing Of Application
Once my program's algorithmic structure is complete I will test a list of practical commands. I will work to test as many potential use cases of my program I can find to see if they run adequately and then bug fix and redesign issues until the program is up to quality and has fully met the client’s requirements. Some of these test cases include:

Checking the arithmetic operations are working fine- +, -, /, * etc.
- Verify that hitting ‘C’ cancels any digits or operations added.
- Verify that all the buttons are present and text written on them is readable.
- Verify that the calculator gives the correct result in case of operations containing decimal numbers.
- Verify the spacing between the two buttons is uncluttered.
- Verify the number of digits allowed to enter in the calculator for any operation.
- Check if keeping the calculator unused for a certain period of time, turns it off automatically
- Verify that on pressing two operators one after the other, the latest one will override the previous operator.
- Verify the state of the calculator when two buttons are pressed simultaneously.

### Presentation of Application
With my application I will create a small instructional write up on how to use the tkinter graphical user interface effectively just in case I forget or share with someone who is unsure. I also included the lab environment specifications in case they need to be setup.

You can run this program in visual studio code or notepad++ by selecting the python file after selecting run. The final product shown below.

Everything past this point is extra research and study with less formatting then the above work. I added it for revision purposes but kept it apart to avoid clutter 👍

### chat/input bots
I find it good when working in IT to almost redo my work once I have gained fresh skills and experience.
I looked into the chatbot genre of programs.
python chatbots can be complex generative programs that can formulate their own original responses or simple rule-based programs that give predefined responses.I find the broad task of a chatbot optimal as the programs complexibility is very flexible allowing me to relax aswell as have freedom to push myself and expand on my programing skills.

### practical use/research
I spent some time looking into diffrent types of chatbots and how/why they are used.
I good pratical use of chatbots are for customer support on websites. A user query could be, “Show me hotels in Christchurch for tomorrow.” and the bot will help the user find hotels.
Some chatbots are advanced virtual assistants like Alexa or Siri who can help you use technology more efficiently and naturally.
And some such as Cleverbot.com are for entertainment.

### I started by building a very simple chatbot that will just repeat a users prompt.

Basic program running successfully:

### Magic 8 Ball

I found a project map online for a slightly more advanced Magic 8 Ball chatbot, It uses the random module allowing for an unspecific but entertaining response for the users question. as shown below.

<a href="magic8ball"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y7UUoSp.png" title="magic8ball" /></a>

### More pratical project example

My next pratice was a program to help automatically calculate shipping costs.

I was given a set of rules for shipping costs as shown below:

<a href="shiprules"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2UpMGgo.png" title="shiprules" /></a>

My program will take a shipped product's weight and calculate the most cost efficient options for delivery.

<a href="ship2"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/okFj0yH.png" title="ship2" /></a>

the code checks the price of each shipping option according to the rules and outputs all options.

<a href="ship3"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zfiG4lB.png" title="ship3" /></a>

I am inspired by this completed product as I can see its obvious use and potential. Some simple advancements could be the ability to find the cheapest of the three options or even ask for the input before calculating for a more personal experience.
